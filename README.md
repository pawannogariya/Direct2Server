Direct2Server
=============

Direct2Server is a tiny JS library for MVC pattern applications, which allows you to directly bind server methods with DOM element events.

It is a utility that allows you to call server methods asynchronously on any DOM event just like you call javascript methods, without writing a piece of code for ajax support.

It is dependent on jquery and works for all the version of jquery.
